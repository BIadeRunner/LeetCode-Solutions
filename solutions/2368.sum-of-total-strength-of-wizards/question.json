{"question_id": "2368", "problem_slug": "sum-of-total-strength-of-wizards", "problem_title": "Sum of Total Strength of Wizards", "content": "As the ruler of a kingdom, you have an army of wizards at your command.\nYou are given a 0-indexed integer array strength, where strength[i] denotes the strength of the ith wizard. For a contiguous group of wizards (i.e. the wizards' strengths form a subarray of strength), the total strength is defined as the product of the following two values:\n\nThe strength of the weakest wizard in the group.\nThe total of all the individual strengths of the wizards in the group.\n\nReturn the sum of the total strengths of all contiguous groups of wizards. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\nA subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: strength = [1,3,1,2]\nOutput: 44\nExplanation: The following are all the contiguous groups of wizards:\n- [1] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1]) * sum([1]) = 1 * 1 = 1\n- [3] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([3]) * sum([3]) = 3 * 3 = 9\n- [1] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1]) * sum([1]) = 1 * 1 = 1\n- [2] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([2]) * sum([2]) = 2 * 2 = 4\n- [1,3] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1,3]) * sum([1,3]) = 1 * 4 = 4\n- [3,1] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([3,1]) * sum([3,1]) = 1 * 4 = 4\n- [1,2] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1,2]) * sum([1,2]) = 1 * 3 = 3\n- [1,3,1] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1,3,1]) * sum([1,3,1]) = 1 * 5 = 5\n- [3,1,2] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([3,1,2]) * sum([3,1,2]) = 1 * 6 = 6\n- [1,3,1,2] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1,3,1,2]) * sum([1,3,1,2]) = 1 * 7 = 7\nThe sum of all the total strengths is 1 + 9 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 44.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: strength = [5,4,6]\nOutput: 213\nExplanation: The following are all the contiguous groups of wizards: \n- [5] from [5,4,6] has a total strength of min([5]) * sum([5]) = 5 * 5 = 25\n- [4] from [5,4,6] has a total strength of min([4]) * sum([4]) = 4 * 4 = 16\n- [6] from [5,4,6] has a total strength of min([6]) * sum([6]) = 6 * 6 = 36\n- [5,4] from [5,4,6] has a total strength of min([5,4]) * sum([5,4]) = 4 * 9 = 36\n- [4,6] from [5,4,6] has a total strength of min([4,6]) * sum([4,6]) = 4 * 10 = 40\n- [5,4,6] from [5,4,6] has a total strength of min([5,4,6]) * sum([5,4,6]) = 4 * 15 = 60\nThe sum of all the total strengths is 25 + 16 + 36 + 36 + 40 + 60 = 213.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= strength.length <= 105\n1 <= strength[i] <= 109\n\n", "hints": ["Consider the contribution of each wizard to the answer.", "Can you efficiently calculate the total contribution to the answer for all subarrays that end at each index?", "Denote the total contribution of all subarrays ending at index i as solve[i].
