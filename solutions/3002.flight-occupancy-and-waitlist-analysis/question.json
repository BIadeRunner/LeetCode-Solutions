As there are 3 passengers who have booked tickets, only 2 passengers can get a seat. Therefore, 2 passengers are successfully booked, and 1 passenger is on the waitlist.\n- Flight 2 has a capacity of 2. Since there are exactly 2 passengers who booked tickets, everyone can secure a seat. As a result, 2 passengers successfully booked their seats and there are no passengers on the waitlist.\n- Flight 3 has a capacity of 1. As there are 2 passengers who have booked tickets, only 1 passenger can get a seat. Therefore, 1 passenger is successfully booked, and 1 passenger is on the waitlist.\n</pre>\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\":{\"Flights\":[\"flight_id\",\"capacity\"],\"Passengers\":[\"passenger_id\",\"flight_id\"]},\"rows\":{\"Flights\":[[1,2],[2,2],[3,1]],\"Passengers\":[[101,1],[102,1],[103,1],[104,2],[105,2],[106,3],[107,3]]}}", "codeSnippets": [{"lang": "MySQL", "langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, {"lang": "MS SQL Server", "langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, {"lang": "Oracle", "langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, {"lang": "Pandas", "langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef waitlist_analysis(flights: pd.DataFrame, passengers: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, {"lang": "PostgreSQL", "langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}], "similarQuestionList": []}
