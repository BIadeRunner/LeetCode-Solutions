{"question_id": "2199", "problem_slug": "two-furthest-houses-with-different-colors", "problem_title": "Two Furthest Houses With Different Colors", "content": "There are n houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifully painted. You are given a 0-indexed integer array colors of length n, where colors[i] represents the color of the ith house.\nReturn the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.\nThe distance between the ith and jth houses is abs(i - j), where abs(x) is the absolute value of x.\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: colors = [1,1,1,6,1,1,1]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, and color 6 is red.\nThe furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 3.\nHouse 0 has color 1, and house 3 has color 6. The distance between them is abs(0 - 3) = 3.\nNote that houses 3 and 6 can also produce the optimal answer.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: colors = [1,8,3,8,3]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, color 8 is yellow, and color 3 is green.\nThe furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 4.\nHouse 0 has color 1, and house 4 has color 3. The distance between them is abs(0 - 4) = 4.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: colors = [0,1]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 1.\nHouse 0 has color 0, and house 1 has color 1. The distance between them is abs(0 - 1) = 1.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nn == colors.length\n2 <= n <= 100\n0 <= colors[i] <= 100\nTest data are generated such that at least two houses have different colors.\n\n", "hints": ["The constraints are small.
