{"question_id": "2111", "problem_slug": "binary-searchable-numbers-in-an-unsorted-array", "problem_title": "Binary Searchable Numbers in an Unsorted Array", "content": "Consider a function that implements an algorithm similar to Binary Search. The function has two input parameters: sequence is a sequence of integers, and target is an integer value. The purpose of the function is to find if the target exists in the sequence.\nThe pseudocode of the function is as follows:\n\nfunc(sequence, target)\n  while sequence is not empty\n    randomly choose an element from sequence as the pivot\n    if pivot = target, return true\n    else if pivot < target, remove pivot and all elements to its left from the sequence\n    else, remove pivot and all elements to its right from the sequence\n  end while\n  return false\n\nWhen the sequence is sorted, the function works correctly for all values. When the sequence is not sorted, the function does not work for all values, but may still work for some values.\nGiven an integer array nums, representing the sequence, that contains unique numbers and may or may not be sorted, return the number of values that are guaranteed to be found using the function, for every possible pivot selection.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [7]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nSearching for value 7 is guaranteed to be found.\nSince the sequence has only one element, 7 will be chosen as the pivot. Because the pivot equals the target, the function will return true.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [-1,5,2]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nSearching for value -1 is guaranteed to be found.\nIf -1 was chosen as the pivot, the function would return true.\nIf 5 was chosen as the pivot, 5 and 2 would be removed. In the next loop, the sequence would have only -1 and the function would return true.\nIf 2 was chosen as the pivot, 2 would be removed. In the next loop, the sequence would have -1 and 5. No matter which number was chosen as the next pivot, the function would find -1 and return true.\n\nSearching for value 5 is NOT guaranteed to be found.\nIf 2 was chosen as the pivot, -1, 5 and 2 would be removed. The sequence would be empty and the function would return false.\n\nSearching for value 2 is NOT guaranteed to be found.\nIf 5 was chosen as the pivot, 5 and 2 would be removed. In the next loop, the sequence would have only -1 and the function would return false.\n\nBecause only -1 is guaranteed to be found, you should return 1.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n-105 <= nums[i] <= 105\nAll the values of nums are unique.\n\n \nFollow-up: If nums has duplicates, would you modify your algorithm? If so, how?\n", "hints": ["The target will not be found if it is removed from the sequence. When does this occur?", "If a pivot is to the left of and is greater than the target, then the target will be removed. The same occurs when the pivot is to the right of and is less than the target.", "Since any element can be chosen as the pivot, for any target NOT to be removed, the condition described in the previous hint must never occur."], "exampleTestcases": "[7]\n[-1,5,2]", "codeSnippets": {"C++": {"langSlug": "cpp", "code": "class Solution {\npublic:\n    int binarySearchableNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {\n        \n    }\n};"}, "Java": {"langSlug": "java", "code": "class Solution {\n    public int binarySearchableNumbers(int[] nums) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Python": {"langSlug": "python", "code": "class Solution(object):\n    def binarySearchableNumbers(self, nums):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type nums: List[int]\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        "}, "Python3": {"langSlug": "python3", "code": "class Solution:\n    def binarySearchableNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        "}, "C": {"langSlug": "c", "code": "int binarySearchableNumbers(int* nums, int numsSize) {\n    \n}"}, "C#": {"langSlug": "csharp", "code": "public class Solution {\n    public int BinarySearchableNumbers(int[] nums) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "JavaScript": {"langSlug": "javascript", "code": "/**\n * @param {number[]} nums\n * @return {number}\n */\nvar binarySearchableNumbers = function(nums) {\n    \n};"}, "TypeScript": {"langSlug": "typescript", "code": "function binarySearchableNumbers(nums: number[]): number {\n    \n};"}, "PHP": {"langSlug": "php", "code": "class Solution {\n\n    /**\n     * @param Integer[] $nums\n     * @return Integer\n     */\n    function binarySearchableNumbers($nums) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Swift": {"langSlug": "swift", "code": "class Solution {\n    func binarySearchableNumbers(_ nums: [Int]) -> Int {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Kotlin": {"langSlug": "kotlin", "code": "class Solution {\n    fun binarySearchableNumbers(nums: IntArray): Int {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Dart": {"langSlug": "dart", "code": "class Solution {\n  int binarySearchableNumbers(List<int> nums) {\n    \n  }\n}"}, "Go": {"langSlug": "golang", "code": "func binarySearchableNumbers(nums []int) int {\n    \n}"}, "Ruby": {"langSlug": "ruby", "code": "# @param {Integer[]} nums\n# @return {Integer}\ndef binary_searchable_numbers(nums)\n    \nend"}, "Scala": {"langSlug": "scala", "code": "object Solution {\n    def binarySearchableNumbers(nums: Array[Int]): Int = {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Rust": {"langSlug": "rust", "code": "impl Solution {\n    pub fn binary_searchable_numbers(nums: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Racket": {"langSlug": "racket", "code": "(define/contract (binary-searchable-numbers nums)\n  (-> (listof exact-integer?) exact-integer?)\n  )"}, "Erlang": {"langSlug": "erlang", "code": "-spec binary_searchable_numbers(Nums :: [integer()]) -> integer().\nbinary_searchable_numbers(Nums) ->\n  ."}, "Elixir": {"langSlug": "elixir", "code": "defmodule Solution do\n  @spec binary_searchable_numbers(nums :: [integer]) :: integer\n  def binary_searchable_numbers(nums) do\n    \n  end\nend"}}}
