{"question_id": "2846", "problem_slug": "robot-collisions", "problem_title": "Robot Collisions", "content": "There are n 1-indexed robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.\nYou are given 0-indexed integer arrays positions, healths, and a string directions (directions[i] is either 'L' for left or 'R' for right). All integers in positions are unique.\nAll robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide.\nIf two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot decreases by one. The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going. If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line.\nYour task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order that the robots were given, i.e. final health of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.\nReturn an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.\nNote: The positions may be unsorted.\n \n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: positions = [5,4,3,2,1], healths = [2,17,9,15,10], directions = \"RRRRR\"\nOutput: [2,17,9,15,10]\nExplanation: No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction. So, the health of the robots in order from the first robot is returned, [2, 17, 9, 15, 10].\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: positions = [3,5,2,6], healths = [10,10,15,12], directions = \"RLRL\"\nOutput: [14]\nExplanation: There are 2 collisions in this example. Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: positions = [1,2,5,6], healths = [10,10,11,11], directions = \"RLRL\"\nOutput: []\nExplanation: Robot 1 and robot 2 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. Robot 3 and 4 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. So, we return an empty array, [].\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= positions.length == healths.length == directions.length == n <= 105\n1 <= positions[i], healths[i] <= 109\ndirections[i] == 'L' or directions[i] == 'R'\nAll values in positions are distinct\n\n", "hints": ["Process the robots in the order of their positions to ensure that we process the collisions correctly.", "To optimize the solution, use a stack to keep track of the surviving robots as we iterate through the positions.", "Instead of simulating each collision, check the current robot against the top of the stack (if it exists) to determine if a collision occurs."], "exampleTestcases": "[5,4,3,2,1]\n[2,17,9,15,10]\n\"RRRRR\"\n[3,5,2,6]\n[10,10,15,12]\n\"RLRL\"\n[1,2,5,6]\n[10,10,11,11]\n\"RLRL\"", "codeSnippets": {"C++": {"langSlug": "cpp", "code": "class Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<int> survivedRobotsHealths(vector<int>& positions, vector<int>& healths, string directions) {\n        \n    }\n};"}, "Java": {"langSlug": "java", "code": "class Solution {\n    public List<Integer> survivedRobotsHealths(int[] positions, int[] healths, String directions) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Python": {"langSlug": "python", "code": "class Solution(object):\n    def survivedRobotsHealths(self, positions, healths, directions):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type positions: List[int]\n        :type healths: List[int]\n        :type directions: str\n        :rtype: List[int]\n        \"\"\"\n        "}, "Python3": {"langSlug": "python3", "code": "class Solution:\n    def survivedRobotsHealths(self, positions: List[int], healths: List[int], directions: str) -> List[int]:\n        "}, "C": {"langSlug": "c", "code": "/**\n * Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().\n */\nint* survivedRobotsHealths(int* positions, int positionsSize, int* healths, int healthsSize, char * directions, int* returnSize){\n\n}"}, "C#": {"langSlug": "csharp", "code": "public class Solution {\n    public IList<int> SurvivedRobotsHealths(int[] positions, int[] healths, string directions) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "JavaScript": {"langSlug": "javascript", "code": "/**\n * @param {number[]} positions\n * @param {number[]} healths\n * @param {string} directions\n * @return {number[]}\n */\nvar survivedRobotsHealths = function(positions, healths, directions) {\n    \n};"}, "TypeScript": {"langSlug": "typescript", "code": "function survivedRobotsHealths(positions: number[], healths: number[], directions: string): number[] {\n\n};"}, "PHP": {"langSlug": "php", "code": "class Solution {\n\n    /**\n     * @param Integer[] $positions\n     * @param Integer[] $healths\n     * @param String $directions\n     * @return Integer[]\n     */\n    function survivedRobotsHealths($positions, $healths, $directions) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Swift": {"langSlug": "swift", "code": "class Solution {\n    func survivedRobotsHealths(_ positions: [Int], _ healths: [Int], _ directions: String) -> [Int] {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Kotlin": {"langSlug": "kotlin", "code": "class Solution {\n    fun survivedRobotsHealths(positions: IntArray, healths: IntArray, directions: String): List<Int> {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Dart": {"langSlug": "dart", "code": "class Solution {\n  List<int> survivedRobotsHealths(List<int> positions, List<int> healths, String directions) {\n\n  }\n}"}, "Go": {"langSlug": "golang", "code": "func survivedRobotsHealths(positions []int, healths []int, directions string) []int {\n    \n}"}, "Ruby": {"langSlug": "ruby", "code": "# @param {Integer[]} positions\n# @param {Integer[]} healths\n# @param {String} directions\n# @return {Integer[]}\ndef survived_robots_healths(positions, healths, directions)\n    \nend"}, "Scala": {"langSlug": "scala", "code": "object Solution {\n    def survivedRobotsHealths(positions: Array[Int], healths: Array[Int], directions: String): List[Int] = {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Rust": {"langSlug": "rust", "code": "impl Solution {\n    pub fn survived_robots_healths(positions: Vec<i32>, healths: Vec<i32>, directions: String) -> Vec<i32> {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Racket": {"langSlug": "racket", "code": "(define/contract (survived-robots-healths positions healths directions)\n  (-> (listof exact-integer?)
