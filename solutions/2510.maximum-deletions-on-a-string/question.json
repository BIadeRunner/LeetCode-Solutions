{"question_id": "2510", "problem_slug": "maximum-deletions-on-a-string", "problem_title": "Maximum Deletions on a String", "content": "You are given a string s consisting of only lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can:\n\nDelete the entire string s, or\nDelete the first i letters of s if the first i letters of s are equal to the following i letters in s, for any i in the range 1 <= i <= s.length / 2.\n\nFor example, if s = \"ababc\", then in one operation, you could delete the first two letters of s to get \"abc\", since the first two letters of s and the following two letters of s are both equal to \"ab\".\nReturn the maximum number of operations needed to delete all of s.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abcabcdabc\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n- Delete the first 3 letters (\"abc\") since the next 3 letters are equal. Now, s = \"abcdabc\".\n- Delete all the letters.\nWe used 2 operations so return 2. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of operations needed.\nNote that in the second operation we cannot delete \"abc\" again because the next occurrence of \"abc\" does not happen in the next 3 letters.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"aaabaab\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\n- Delete the first letter (\"a\") since the next letter is equal. Now, s = \"aabaab\".\n- Delete the first 3 letters (\"aab\") since the next 3 letters are equal. Now, s = \"aab\".\n- Delete the first letter (\"a\") since the next letter is equal. Now, s = \"ab\".\n- Delete all the letters.\nWe used 4 operations so return 4. It can be proven that 4 is the maximum number of operations needed.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"aaaaa\"\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: In each operation, we can delete the first letter of s.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 4000\ns consists only of lowercase English letters.\n\n", "hints": ["We can use dynamic programming to find the answer. Create a 0-indexed dp array where dp[i] represents the maximum number of moves needed to remove the first i + 1 letters from s.", "What should we do if there is an i where it is impossible to remove the first i + 1 letters?", "Use a sentinel value such as -1 to show that it is impossible.", "How can we quickly determine if two substrings of s are equal? We can use hashing."], "exampleTestcases": "\"abcabcdabc\"\n\"aaabaab\"\n\"aaaaa\"", "codeSnippets": {"C++": {"langSlug": "cpp", "code": "class Solution {\npublic:\n    int deleteString(string s) {\n        \n    }\n};"}, "Java": {"langSlug": "java", "code": "class Solution {\n    public int deleteString(String s) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Python": {"langSlug": "python", "code": "class Solution(object):\n    def deleteString(self, s):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type s: str\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        "}, "Python3": {"langSlug": "python3", "code": "class Solution:\n    def deleteString(self, s: str) -> int:\n        "}, "C": {"langSlug": "c", "code": "int deleteString(char* s) {\n    \n}"}, "C#": {"langSlug": "csharp", "code": "public class Solution {\n    public int DeleteString(string s) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "JavaScript": {"langSlug": "javascript", "code": "/**\n * @param {string} s\n * @return {number}\n */\nvar deleteString = function(s) {\n    \n};"}, "TypeScript": {"langSlug": "typescript", "code": "function deleteString(s: string): number {\n    \n};"}, "PHP": {"langSlug": "php", "code": "class Solution {\n\n    /**\n     * @param String $s\n     * @return Integer\n     */\n    function deleteString($s) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Swift": {"langSlug": "swift", "code": "class Solution {\n    func deleteString(_ s: String) -> Int {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Kotlin": {"langSlug": "kotlin", "code": "class Solution {\n    fun deleteString(s: String): Int {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Dart": {"langSlug": "dart", "code": "class Solution {\n  int deleteString(String s) {\n    \n  }\n}"}, "Go": {"langSlug": "golang", "code": "func deleteString(s string) int {\n    \n}"}, "Ruby": {"langSlug": "ruby", "code": "# @param {String} s\n# @return {Integer}\ndef delete_string(s)\n    \nend"}, "Scala": {"langSlug": "scala", "code": "object Solution {\n    def deleteString(s: String): Int = {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Rust": {"langSlug": "rust", "code": "impl Solution {\n    pub fn delete_string(s: String) -> i32 {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Racket": {"langSlug": "racket", "code": "(define/contract (delete-string s)\n  (-> string? exact-integer?)\n  )"}, "Erlang": {"langSlug": "erlang", "code": "-spec delete_string(S :: unicode:unicode_binary()) -> integer().\ndelete_string(S) ->\n  ."}, "Elixir": {"langSlug": "elixir", "code": "defmodule Solution do\n  @spec delete_string(s :: String.t) :: integer\n  def delete_string(s) do\n    \n  end\nend"}}}
