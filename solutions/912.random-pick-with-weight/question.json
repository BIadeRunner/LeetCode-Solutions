{"question_id": "912", "problem_slug": "random-pick-with-weight", "problem_title": "Random Pick with Weight", "content": "You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of the ith index.\nYou need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index in the range [0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).\n\nFor example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput\n[\"Solution\",\"pickIndex\"]\n[[[1]],[]]\nOutput\n[null,0]\n\nExplanation\nSolution solution = new Solution([1]);\nsolution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput\n[\"Solution\",\"pickIndex\",\"pickIndex\",\"pickIndex\",\"pickIndex\",\"pickIndex\"]\n[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]\nOutput\n[null,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nExplanation\nSolution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);\nsolution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.\nsolution.pickIndex(); // return 1\nsolution.pickIndex(); // return 1\nsolution.pickIndex(); // return 1\nsolution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.\n\nSince this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed.\nAll of the following outputs can be considered correct:\n[null,1,1,1,1,0]\n[null,1,1,1,1,1]\n[null,1,1,1,0,0]\n[null,1,1,1,0,1]\n[null,1,0,1,0,0]\n......\nand so on.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= w.length <= 104\n1 <= w[i] <= 105\npickIndex will be called at most 104 times.\n\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases":
