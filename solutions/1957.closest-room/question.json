{"question_id": "1957", "problem_slug": "closest-room", "problem_title": "Closest Room", "content": "There is a hotel with n rooms. The rooms are represented by a 2D integer array rooms where rooms[i] = [roomIdi, sizei] denotes that there is a room with room number roomIdi and size equal to sizei. Each roomIdi is guaranteed to be unique.\nYou are also given k queries in a 2D array queries where queries[j] = [preferredj, minSizej]. The answer to the jth query is the room number id of a room such that:\n\nThe room has a size of at least minSizej, and\nabs(id - preferredj) is minimized, where abs(x) is the absolute value of x.\n\nIf there is a tie in the absolute difference, then use the room with the smallest such id. If there is no such room, the answer is -1.\nReturn an array answer of length k where answer[j] contains the answer to the jth query.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: rooms = [[2,2],[1,2],[3,2]], queries = [[3,1],[3,3],[5,2]]\nOutput: [3,-1,3]\nExplanation: The answers to the queries are as follows:\nQuery = [3,1]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 3) = 0, and its size of 2 is at least 1. The answer is 3.\nQuery = [3,3]: There are no rooms with a size of at least 3, so the answer is -1.\nQuery = [5,2]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 5) = 2, and its size of 2 is at least 2. The answer is 3.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: rooms = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,5],[4,1],[5,2]], queries = [[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\nOutput: [2,1,3]\nExplanation: The answers to the queries are as follows:\nQuery = [2,3]: Room number 2 is the closest as abs(2 - 2) = 0, and its size of 3 is at least 3. The answer is 2.\nQuery = [2,4]: Room numbers 1 and 3 both have sizes of at least 4. The answer is 1 since it is smaller.\nQuery = [2,5]: Room number 3 is the only room with a size of at least 5. The answer is 3.\n \nConstraints:\n\nn == rooms.length\n1 <= n <= 105\nk == queries.length\n1 <= k <= 104\n1 <= roomIdi, preferredj <= 107\n1 <= sizei, minSizej <= 107\n\n", "hints": ["Is there a way to sort the queries so it's easier to search the closest room larger than the size?", "Use binary search to speed up the search time."], "exampleTestcases": "[[2,2],[1,2],[3,2]]\n[[3,1],[3,3],[5,2]]\n[[1,4],[2,3],[3,5],[4,1],[5,2]]\n[[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]", "codeSnippets": {"C++": {"langSlug": "cpp", "code": "class Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<int> closestRoom(vector<vector<int>>& rooms, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {\n        \n    }\n};"}, "Java": {"langSlug": "java", "code": "class Solution {\n    public int[] closestRoom(int[][] rooms, int[][] queries) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Python": {"langSlug": "python", "code": "class Solution(object):\n    def closestRoom(self, rooms, queries):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type rooms: List[List[int]]\n        :type queries: List[List[int]]\n        :rtype: List[int]\n        \"\"\"\n        "}, "Python3": {"langSlug": "python3", "code": "class Solution:\n    def closestRoom(self, rooms: List[List[int]], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        "}, "C": {"langSlug": "c", "code": "/**\n * Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().\n */\nint* closestRoom(int** rooms, int roomsSize, int* roomsColSize, int** queries, int queriesSize, int* queriesColSize, int* returnSize) {\n    \n}"}, "C#": {"langSlug": "csharp", "code": "public class Solution {\n    public int[] ClosestRoom(int[][] rooms, int[][] queries) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "JavaScript": {"langSlug": "javascript", "code": "/**\n * @param {number[][]} rooms\n * @param {number[][]} queries\n * @return {number[]}\n */\nvar closestRoom = function(rooms, queries) {\n    \n};"}, "TypeScript": {"langSlug": "typescript", "code": "function closestRoom(rooms: number[][], queries: number[][]): number[] {\n    \n};"}, "PHP": {"langSlug": "php", "code": "class Solution {\n\n    /**\n     * @param Integer[][] $rooms\n     * @param Integer[][] $queries\n     * @return Integer[]\n     */\n    function closestRoom($rooms, $queries) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Swift": {"langSlug": "swift", "code": "class Solution {\n    func closestRoom(_ rooms: [[Int]], _ queries: [[Int]]) -> [Int] {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Kotlin": {"langSlug": "kotlin", "code": "class Solution {\n    fun closestRoom(rooms: Array<IntArray>, queries: Array<IntArray>): IntArray {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Dart": {"langSlug": "dart", "code": "class Solution {\n  List<int> closestRoom(List<List<int>> rooms, List<List<int>> queries) {\n    \n  }\n}"}, "Go": {"langSlug": "golang", "code": "func closestRoom(rooms [][]int, queries [][]int) []int {\n    \n}"}, "Ruby": {"langSlug": "ruby", "code": "# @param {Integer[][]} rooms\n# @param {Integer[][]} queries\n# @return {Integer[]}\ndef closest_room(rooms, queries)\n    \nend"}, "Scala": {"langSlug": "scala", "code": "object Solution {\n    def closestRoom(rooms: Array[Array[Int]], queries: Array[Array[Int]]): Array[Int] = {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Rust": {"langSlug": "rust", "code": "impl Solution {\n    pub fn closest_room(rooms: Vec<Vec<i32>>, queries: Vec<Vec<i32>>) -> Vec<i32> {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Racket": {"langSlug": "racket", "code": "(define/contract (closest-room rooms queries)\n  (-> (listof (listof exact-integer?))
