{"question_id": "3259", "problem_slug": "binary-tree-nodes", "problem_title": "Binary Tree Nodes", "content": "Table: Tree\n\n+-------------+------+ \n| Column Name | Type | \n+-------------+------+ \n| N           | int  | \n| P           | int  |\n+-------------+------+\nN is the column of unique values for this table.\nEach row includes N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.\n\nWrite a solution to find the node type of the Binary Tree. Output one of the following for each node:\n\nRoot: if the node is the root node.\nLeaf: if the node is the leaf node.\nInner: if the node is neither root nor leaf node.\n\nReturn the result table ordered by node value in ascending order.\nThe result format is in the following example.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nTree table:\n+---+------+\n| N | P    | \n+---+------+\n| 1 | 2    |\n| 3 | 2    | \n| 6 | 8    | \n| 9 | 8    | \n| 2 | 5    | \n| 8 | 5    | \n| 5 | null | \n+---+------+\nOutput: \n+---+-------+\n| N | Type  | \n+---+-------+\n| 1 | Leaf  | \n| 2 | Inner |\n| 3 | Leaf  |\n| 5 | Root  |\n| 6 | Leaf  |\n| 8 | Inner |\n| 9 | Leaf  |    \n+---+-------+\nExplanation: \n- Node 5 is the root node since it has no parent node.\n- Nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9 are leaf nodes because they don't have any child nodes.\n- Nodes 2, and 8 are inner nodes as they serve as parents to some of the nodes in the structure.\n\n \nNote: This question is the same as  608: Tree Node.\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\":{\"Tree\":[\"N\",\"P\"]},\"rows\":{\"Tree\":[[1,2],[3,2],[6,8],[9,8],[2,5],[8,5],[5,null]]}}", "codeSnippets": {"MySQL": {"langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, "MS SQL Server": {"langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Oracle": {"langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Pandas": {"langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef binary_tree_nodes(tree: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, "PostgreSQL": {"langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}}}
