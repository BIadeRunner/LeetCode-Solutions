Employees work in sessions. The number of hours an employee worked can be calculated from the sum of the number of minutes the employee worked in all of their sessions. The number of minutes in each session is rounded up.\n\nFor example, if the employee worked for 51 minutes and 2 seconds in a session, we consider it 52 minutes.\n\nWrite a solution to report the IDs of the employees that will be deducted. In other words, report the IDs of the employees that did not work the needed hours.\nReturn the result table in any order.\nThe result format is in the following example.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nEmployees table:\n+-------------+--------------+\n| employee_id | needed_hours |\n+-------------+--------------+\n| 1           | 20           |\n| 2           | 12           |\n| 3           | 2            |\n+-------------+--------------+\nLogs table:\n+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+\n| employee_id | in_time             | out_time            |\n+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+\n| 1           | 2022-10-01 09:00:00 | 2022-10-01 17:00:00 |\n| 1           | 2022-10-06 09:05:04 | 2022-10-06 17:09:03 |\n| 1           | 2022-10-12 23:00:00 | 2022-10-13 03:00:01 |\n| 2           | 2022-10-29 12:00:00 | 2022-10-29 23:58:58 |\n+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+\nOutput: \n+-------------+\n| employee_id |\n+-------------+\n| 2           |\n| 3           |\n+-------------+\nExplanation: \nEmployee 1:\n - Worked for three sessions:\n    - On 2022-10-01, they worked for 8 hours.\n    - On 2022-10-06, they worked for 8 hours and 4 minutes.\n    - On 2022-10-12, they worked for 4 hours and 1 minute.
