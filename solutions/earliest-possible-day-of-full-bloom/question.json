Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer arrays <code>plantTime</code> and <code>growTime</code>, of length <code>n</code> each:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>plantTime[i]</code> is the number of <strong>full days</strong> it takes you to <strong>plant</strong> the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You <strong>do not</strong> have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete <strong>until</strong> you have worked <code>plantTime[i]</code> days on planting it in total.</li>\n\t<li><code>growTime[i]</code> is the number of <strong>full days</strong> it takes the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> seed to grow after being completely planted. <strong>After</strong> the last day of its growth, the flower <strong>blooms</strong> and stays bloomed forever.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From the beginning of day <code>0</code>, you can plant the seeds in <strong>any</strong> order.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>earliest</strong> possible day where <strong>all</strong> seeds are blooming</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/21/1.png\" style=\"width: 453px; height: 149px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> plantTime = [1,4,3], growTime = [2,3,1]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 9\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.\nOne optimal way is:\nOn day 0, plant the 0<sup>th</sup> seed.
