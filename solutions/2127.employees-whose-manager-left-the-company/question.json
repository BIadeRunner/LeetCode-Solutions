Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). \n\n \nFind the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.\nReturn the result table ordered by employee_id.\nThe result format is in the following example.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput:  \nEmployees table:\n+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+\n| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |\n+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+\n| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |\n| 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |\n| 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |\n| 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |\n| 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |\n| 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |\n+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+\nOutput: \n+-------------+\n| employee_id |\n+-------------+\n| 11          |\n+-------------+\n\nExplanation: \nThe employees with a salary less than $30000 are 1 (Kalel) and 11 (Joziah).\nKalel's manager is employee 11, who is still in the company (Joziah).\nJoziah's manager is employee 6, who left the company because there is no row for employee 6 as it was deleted.\n\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\": {\"Employees\": [\"employee_id\", \"name\", \"manager_id\", \"salary\"]}, \"rows\": {\"Employees\": [[3, \"Mila\", 9, 60301], [12, \"Antonella\", null, 31000], [13, \"Emery\", null, 67084], [1, \"Kalel\", 11, 21241], [9, \"Mikaela\", null, 50937], [11, \"Joziah\", 6, 28485]]}}", "codeSnippets": {"MySQL": {"langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, "MS SQL Server": {"langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Oracle": {"langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Pandas": {"langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef find_employees(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, "PostgreSQL": {"langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}}}
