Each topic can be expressed by one or more keywords. If a keyword of a certain topic exists in the content of a post (case insensitive) then the post has this topic.\nWrite a solution to find the topics of each post according to the following rules:\n\nIf the post does not have keywords from any topic, its topic should be \"Ambiguous!\".\nIf the post has at least one keyword of any topic, its topic should be a string of the IDs of its topics sorted in ascending order and separated by commas ','. The string should not contain duplicate IDs.\n\nReturn the result table in any order.\nThe result format is in the following example.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nKeywords table:\n+----------+----------+\n| topic_id | word     |\n+----------+----------+\n| 1        | handball |\n| 1        | football |\n| 3        | WAR      |\n| 2        | Vaccine  |\n+----------+----------+\nPosts table:\n+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| post_id | content                                                                |\n+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 1       | We call it soccer They call it football hahaha                         |\n| 2       | Americans prefer basketball while Europeans love handball and football |\n| 3       | stop the war and play handball                                         |\n| 4       | warning I planted some flowers this morning and then got vaccinated    |\n+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\nOutput: \n+---------+------------+\n| post_id | topic      |\n+---------+------------+\n| 1       | 1          |\n| 2       | 1          |\n| 3       | 1,3        |\n| 4       | Ambiguous! |\n+---------+------------+\nExplanation: \n1: \"We call it soccer They call it football hahaha\"\n\"football\" expresses topic 1. There is no other word that expresses any other topic.\n\n2: \"Americans prefer basketball while Europeans love handball and football\"\n\"handball\" expresses topic 1. \"football\" expresses topic 1. \nThere is no other word that expresses any other topic.\n\n3: \"stop the war and play handball\"\n\"war\" expresses topic 3. \"handball\" expresses topic 1.\nThere is no other word that expresses any other topic.\n\n4: \"warning I planted some flowers this morning and then got vaccinated\"\nThere is no word in this sentence that expresses any topic. Note that \"warning\" is different from \"war\" although they have a common prefix. \nThis post is ambiguous.\n\nNote that it is okay to have one word that expresses more than one topic.\n\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\": {\"Keywords\": [\"topic_id\", \"word\"], \"Posts\": [\"post_id\", \"content\"]}, \"rows\": {\"Keywords\": [[1, \"handball\"], [1, \"football\"], [3, \"WAR\"], [2, \"Vaccine\"]], \"Posts\": [[1, \"We call it soccer They call it football hahaha\"], [2, \"Americans prefer basketball while Europeans love handball and football\"], [3, \"stop the war and play handball\"], [4, \"warning I planted some flowers this morning and then got vaccinated\"]]}}", "codeSnippets": {"MySQL": {"langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, "MS SQL Server": {"langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Oracle": {"langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Pandas": {"langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef find_topic(keywords: pd.DataFrame, posts: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, "PostgreSQL": {"langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}}}
