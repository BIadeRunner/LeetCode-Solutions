If a bus arrives at the station at a time tbus and a passenger arrived at a time tpassenger where tpassenger <= tbus and the passenger did not catch any bus, the passenger will use that bus. In addition, each bus has a capacity. If at the moment the bus arrives at the station there are more passengers waiting than its capacity capacity, only capacity passengers will use the bus.\nWrite a solution to report the number of users that used each bus.\nReturn the result table ordered by bus_id in ascending order.\nThe result format is in the following example.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nBuses table:\n+--------+--------------+----------+\n| bus_id | arrival_time | capacity |\n+--------+--------------+----------+\n| 1      | 2            | 1        |\n| 2      | 4            | 10       |\n| 3      | 7            | 2        |\n+--------+--------------+----------+\nPassengers table:\n+--------------+--------------+\n| passenger_id | arrival_time |\n+--------------+--------------+\n| 11           | 1            |\n| 12           | 1            |\n| 13           | 5            |\n| 14           | 6            |\n| 15           | 7            |\n+--------------+--------------+\nOutput: \n+--------+----------------+\n| bus_id | passengers_cnt |\n+--------+----------------+\n| 1      | 1              |\n| 2      | 1              |\n| 3      | 2              |\n+--------+----------------+\nExplanation: \n- Passenger 11 arrives at time 1.\n- Passenger 12 arrives at time 1.\n- Bus 1 arrives at time 2 and collects passenger 11 as it has one empty seat.\n\n- Bus 2 arrives at time 4 and collects passenger 12 as it has ten empty seats.\n\n- Passenger 12 arrives at time 5.\n- Passenger 13 arrives at time 6.\n- Passenger 14 arrives at time 7.\n- Bus 3 arrives at time 7 and collects passengers 12 and 13 as it has two empty seats.\n\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\":{\"Buses\":[\"bus_id\",\"arrival_time\",\"capacity\"],\"Passengers\":[\"passenger_id\",\"arrival_time\"]},\"rows\":{\"Buses\":[[1,2,1],[2,4,10],[3,7,2]],\"Passengers\":[[11,1],[12,1],[13,5],[14,6],[15,7]]}}", "codeSnippets": {"MySQL": {"langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, "MS SQL Server": {"langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Oracle": {"langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Pandas": {"langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef number_of_passengers(buses: pd.DataFrame, passengers: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, "PostgreSQL": {"langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}}}
