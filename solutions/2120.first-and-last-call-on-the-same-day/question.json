Calls are counted regardless of being the caller or the recipient.\nReturn the result table in any order.\nThe result format is in the following example.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nCalls table:\n+-----------+--------------+---------------------+\n| caller_id | recipient_id | call_time           |\n+-----------+--------------+---------------------+\n| 8         | 4            | 2021-08-24 17:46:07 |\n| 4         | 8            | 2021-08-24 19:57:13 |\n| 5         | 1            | 2021-08-11 05:28:44 |\n| 8         | 3            | 2021-08-17 04:04:15 |\n| 11        | 3            | 2021-08-17 13:07:00 |\n| 8         | 11           | 2021-08-17 22:22:22 |\n+-----------+--------------+---------------------+\nOutput: \n+---------+\n| user_id |\n+---------+\n| 1       |\n| 4       |\n| 5       |\n| 8       |\n+---------+\nExplanation: \nOn 2021-08-24, the first and last call of this day for user 8 was with user 4. User 8 should be included in the answer.\nSimilarly, user 4 on 2021-08-24 had their first and last call with user 8. User 4 should be included in the answer.\nOn 2021-08-11, user 1 and 5 had a call. This call was the only call for both of them on this day. Since this call is the first and last call of the day for both of them, they should both be included in the answer.\n\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\": {\"Calls\": [\"caller_id\", \"recipient_id\", \"call_time\"]}, \"rows\": {\"Calls\": [[8, 4, \"2021-08-24 17:46:07\"], [4, 8, \"2021-08-24 19:57:13\"], [5, 1, \"2021-08-11 05:28:44\"], [8, 3, \"2021-08-17 04:04:15\"], [11, 3, \"2021-08-17 13:07:00\"], [8, 11, \"2021-08-17 22:22:22\"]]}}", "codeSnippets": {"MySQL": {"langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, "MS SQL Server": {"langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Oracle": {"langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Pandas": {"langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef same_day_calls(calls: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, "PostgreSQL": {"langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}}}
