{"question_id": "3289", "problem_slug": "earliest-second-to-mark-indices-ii", "problem_title": "Earliest Second to Mark Indices II", "content": "You are given two 1-indexed integer arrays, nums and, changeIndices, having lengths n and m, respectively.\nInitially, all indices in nums are unmarked. Your task is to mark all indices in nums.\nIn each second, s, in order from 1 to m (inclusive), you can perform one of the following operations:\n\nChoose an index i in the range [1, n] and decrement nums[i] by 1.\nSet nums[changeIndices[s]] to any non-negative value.\nChoose an index i in the range [1, n], where nums[i] is equal to 0, and mark index i.\nDo nothing.\n\nReturn an integer denoting the earliest second in the range [1, m] when all indices in nums can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or -1 if it is impossible.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [3,2,3], changeIndices = [1,3,2,2,2,2,3]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: In this example, we have 7 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:\nSecond 1: Set nums[changeIndices[1]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,3].\nSecond 2: Set nums[changeIndices[2]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,0].\nSecond 3: Set nums[changeIndices[3]] to 0. nums becomes [0,0,0].\nSecond 4: Mark index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.\nSecond 5: Mark index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.\nSecond 6: Mark index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.\nNow all indices have been marked.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 6th second.\nHence, the answer is 6.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [0,0,1,2], changeIndices = [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: In this example, we have 8 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:\nSecond 1: Mark index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.\nSecond 2: Mark index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.\nSecond 3: Decrement index 4 by one. nums becomes [0,0,1,1].\nSecond 4: Decrement index 4 by one. nums becomes [0,0,1,0].\nSecond 5: Decrement index 3 by one. nums becomes [0,0,0,0].\nSecond 6: Mark index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.\nSecond 7: Mark index 4, since nums[4] is equal to 0.\nNow all indices have been marked.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 7th second.\nHence, the answer is 7.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3], changeIndices = [1,2,3]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: In this example, it can be shown that it is impossible to mark all indices, as we don't have enough seconds. \nHence, the answer is -1.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n == nums.length <= 5000\n0 <= nums[i] <= 109\n1 <= m == changeIndices.length <= 5000\n1 <= changeIndices[i] <= n\n\n", "hints": ["We need at least <code>n</code> seconds, and at most <code>sum(nums[i]) + n</code> seconds.", "We can binary search the earliest second where all indices can be marked.", "If there is an operation where we change <code>nums[changeIndices[i]]</code> to a non-negative value, it is best for it to satisfy the following constraints:<ul>\r\n<li><code>nums[changeIndices[i]]</code> should not be equal to <code>0</code>.</li>\r\n<li><code>nums[changeIndices[i]]</code> should be changed to <code>0</code>.</li>\r\n<li>It should be the first position where <code>changeIndices[i]</code> occurs in <code>changeIndices</code>.</li>\r\n<li>There should be another second, <code>j</code>, where <code>changeIndices[i]</code> will be marked. <code>j</code> is in the range <code>[i + 1, m]</code>.</li>\r\n</ul>", "Let <code>time_needed = sum(nums[i]) + n</code>.
