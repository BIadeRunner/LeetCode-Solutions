{"question_id": "2778", "problem_slug": "frequency-tracker", "problem_title": "Frequency Tracker", "content": "Design a data structure that keeps track of the values in it and answers some queries regarding their frequencies.\nImplement the FrequencyTracker class.\n\nFrequencyTracker(): Initializes the FrequencyTracker object with an empty array initially.\nvoid add(int number): Adds number to the data structure.\nvoid deleteOne(int number): Deletes one occurrence of number from the data structure. The data structure may not contain number, and in this case nothing is deleted.\nbool hasFrequency(int frequency): Returns true if there is a number in the data structure that occurs frequency number of times, otherwise, it returns false.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput\n[\"FrequencyTracker\", \"add\", \"add\", \"hasFrequency\"]\n[[], [3], [3], [2]]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, true]\n\nExplanation\nFrequencyTracker frequencyTracker = new FrequencyTracker();\nfrequencyTracker.add(3); // The data structure now contains [3]\nfrequencyTracker.add(3); // The data structure now contains [3, 3]\nfrequencyTracker.hasFrequency(2); // Returns true, because 3 occurs twice\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput\n[\"FrequencyTracker\", \"add\", \"deleteOne\", \"hasFrequency\"]\n[[], [1], [1], [1]]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, false]\n\nExplanation\nFrequencyTracker frequencyTracker = new FrequencyTracker();\nfrequencyTracker.add(1); // The data structure now contains [1]\nfrequencyTracker.deleteOne(1); // The data structure becomes empty []\nfrequencyTracker.hasFrequency(1); // Returns false, because the data structure is empty\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput\n[\"FrequencyTracker\", \"hasFrequency\", \"add\", \"hasFrequency\"]\n[[], [2], [3], [1]]\nOutput\n[null, false, null, true]\n\nExplanation\nFrequencyTracker frequencyTracker = new FrequencyTracker();\nfrequencyTracker.hasFrequency(2); // Returns false, because the data structure is empty\nfrequencyTracker.add(3); // The data structure now contains [3]\nfrequencyTracker.hasFrequency(1); // Returns true, because 3 occurs once\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= number <= 105\n1 <= frequency <= 105\nAt most, 2 * 105 calls will be made to add, deleteOne, and hasFrequency in total.\n\n", "hints": ["Put all the numbers in a hash map (or just an integer array given the number range is small) to maintain each number’s frequency dynamically.", "Put each
