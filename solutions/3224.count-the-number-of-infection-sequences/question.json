This process continues until everyone is infected.\nAn infection sequence is the order in which uninfected people become infected, excluding those initially infected.\nReturn the number of different infection sequences possible, modulo 109+7.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5, sick = [0,4]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\nThere is a total of 6 different sequences overall.\n\nValid infection sequences are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [3,2,1] and [3,1,2].\n[2,3,1] and [2,1,3] are not valid infection sequences because the person at index 2 cannot be infected at the first step.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 4, sick = [1]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nThere is a total of 6 different sequences overall.\n\nValid infection sequences are [0,2,3], [2,0,3] and [2,3,0].\n[3,2,0], [3,0,2], and [0,3,2] are not valid infection sequences because the infection starts at the person at index 1, then the order of infection is 2, then 3, and hence 3 cannot be infected earlier than 2.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n <= 105\n1 <= sick.length <= n - 1\n0 <= sick[i] <= n - 1\nsick is sorted in increasing order.\n\n", "hints": ["Consider infected children as <code>0</code> and non-infected as <code>1</code>, then divide the array into segments with the same value.", "For each segment of non-infected children whose indices are <code>[i, j]</code> and indices <code>(i - 1)</code> and <code>(j + 1)</code>, if they exist, are already infected.
