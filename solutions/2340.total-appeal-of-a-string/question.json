{"question_id": "2340", "problem_slug": "total-appeal-of-a-string", "problem_title": "Total Appeal of A String", "content": "The appeal of a string is the number of distinct characters found in the string.\n\nFor example, the appeal of \"abbca\" is 3 because it has 3 distinct characters: 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\nGiven a string s, return the total appeal of all of its substrings.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abbca\"\nOutput: 28\nExplanation: The following are the substrings of \"abbca\":\n- Substrings of length 1: \"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"c\", \"a\" have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 5.\n- Substrings of length 2: \"ab\", \"bb\", \"bc\", \"ca\" have an appeal of 2, 1, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 7.\n- Substrings of length 3: \"abb\", \"bbc\", \"bca\" have an appeal of 2, 2, and 3 respectively. The sum is 7.\n- Substrings of length 4: \"abbc\", \"bbca\" have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6.\n- Substrings of length 5: \"abbca\" has an appeal of 3. The sum is 3.\nThe total sum is 5 + 7 + 7 + 6 + 3 = 28.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"code\"\nOutput: 20\nExplanation: The following are the substrings of \"code\":\n- Substrings of length 1: \"c\", \"o\", \"d\", \"e\" have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 4.\n- Substrings of length 2: \"co\", \"od\", \"de\" have an appeal of 2, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 6.\n- Substrings of length 3: \"cod\", \"ode\" have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6.\n- Substrings of length 4: \"code\" has an appeal of 4. The sum is 4.\nThe total sum is 4 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 20.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n", "hints": ["Consider the set of substrings that end at a certain index i.
