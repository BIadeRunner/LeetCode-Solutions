{"question_id": "133", "problem_slug": "clone-graph", "problem_title": "Clone Graph", "content": "Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.\nReturn a deep copy (clone) of the graph.\nEach node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.\n\nclass Node {\n    public int val;\n    public List<Node> neighbors;\n}\n\n \nTest case format:\nFor simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.\nAn adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.\nThe given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]\nOutput: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]\nExplanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.\n1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).\n2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).\n3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).\n4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: adjList = [[]]\nOutput: [[]]\nExplanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: adjList = []\nOutput: []\nExplanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].\n1 <= Node.val <= 100\nNode.val is unique for each node.\nThere are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.\nThe Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.\n\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "[[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]\n[[]]\n[]", "codeSnippets": {"C++": {"langSlug": "cpp", "code": "/*\n// Definition for a Node.\nclass Node {\npublic:\n    int val;\n    vector<Node*> neighbors;\n    Node() {\n        val = 0;\n        neighbors = vector<Node*>();\n    }\n    Node(int _val) {\n        val = _val;\n        neighbors = vector<Node*>();\n    }\n    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _neighbors) {\n        val = _val;\n        neighbors = _neighbors;\n    }\n};\n*/\n\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {\n        \n    }\n};"}, "Java": {"langSlug": "java", "code": "/*\n// Definition for a Node.\nclass Node {\n    public int val;\n    public List<Node> neighbors;\n    public Node() {\n        val = 0;\n        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();\n    }\n    public Node(int _val) {\n        val = _val;\n        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();\n    }\n    public Node(int _val, ArrayList<Node> _neighbors) {\n        val = _val;\n        neighbors = _neighbors;\n    }\n}\n*/\n\nclass Solution {\n    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Python": {"langSlug": "python", "code": "\"\"\"\n# Definition for a Node.\nclass Node(object):\n    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []\n\"\"\"\n\nclass Solution(object):\n    def cloneGraph(self, node):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type node: Node\n        :rtype: Node\n        \"\"\"\n        "}, "Python3": {"langSlug": "python3", "code": "\"\"\"\n# Definition for a Node.\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom typing import Optional\nclass Solution:\n    def cloneGraph(self, node: Optional['Node']) -> Optional['Node']:\n        "}, "C": {"langSlug": "c", "code": "/**\n * Definition for a Node.\n * struct Node {\n *     int val;\n *     int numNeighbors;\n *     struct Node** neighbors;\n * };\n */\n\nstruct Node *cloneGraph(struct Node *s) {\n\t\n}"}, "C#": {"langSlug": "csharp", "code": "/*\n// Definition for a Node.\npublic class Node {\n    public int val;\n    public IList<Node> neighbors;\n\n    public Node() {\n        val = 0;\n        neighbors = new List<Node>();\n    }\n\n    public Node(int _val) {\n        val = _val;\n        neighbors = new List<Node>();\n    }\n\n    public Node(int _val, List<Node> _neighbors) {\n        val = _val;\n        neighbors = _neighbors;\n    }\n}\n*/\n\npublic class Solution {\n    public Node CloneGraph(Node node) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "JavaScript": {"langSlug": "javascript", "code": "/**\n * // Definition for a _Node.\n * function _Node(val, neighbors) {\n *    this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;\n *    this.neighbors = neighbors === undefined ?
