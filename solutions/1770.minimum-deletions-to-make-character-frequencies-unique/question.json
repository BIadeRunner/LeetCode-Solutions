{"question_id": "1770", "problem_slug": "minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique", "problem_title": "Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique", "content": "A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.\nGiven a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.\nThe frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string \"aab\", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"aab\"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: s is already good.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"aaabbbcc\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string \"aaabcc\".\nAnother way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string \"aaabbc\".\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"ceabaacb\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string \"eabaab\".\nNote that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns contains only lowercase English letters.\n\n", "hints": ["As we can only delete characters, if we have multiple characters having the same frequency, we must decrease all the frequencies of them, except one.", "Sort the alphabet characters by their frequencies non-increasingly.", "Iterate on the alphabet characters, keep decreasing the frequency of the current character until it reaches a value that has not appeared before."], "exampleTestcases": "\"aab\"\n\"aaabbbcc\"\n\"ceabaacb\"", "codeSnippets": {"C++": {"langSlug": "cpp", "code": "class Solution {\npublic:\n    int minDeletions(string s) {\n        \n    }\n};"}, "Java": {"langSlug": "java", "code": "class Solution {\n    public int minDeletions(String s) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Python": {"langSlug": "python", "code": "class Solution(object):\n    def minDeletions(self, s):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type s: str\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        "}, "Python3": {"langSlug": "python3", "code": "class Solution:\n    def minDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:\n        "}, "C": {"langSlug": "c", "code": "int minDeletions(char* s) {\n    \n}"}, "C#": {"langSlug": "csharp", "code": "public class Solution {\n    public int MinDeletions(string s) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "JavaScript": {"langSlug": "javascript", "code": "/**\n * @param {string} s\n * @return {number}\n */\nvar minDeletions = function(s) {\n    \n};"}, "TypeScript": {"langSlug": "typescript", "code": "function minDeletions(s: string): number {\n    \n};"}, "PHP": {"langSlug": "php", "code": "class Solution {\n\n    /**\n     * @param String $s\n     * @return Integer\n     */\n    function minDeletions($s) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Swift": {"langSlug": "swift", "code": "class Solution {\n    func minDeletions(_ s: String) -> Int {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Kotlin": {"langSlug": "kotlin", "code": "class Solution {\n    fun minDeletions(s: String): Int {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Dart": {"langSlug": "dart", "code": "class Solution {\n  int minDeletions(String s) {\n    \n  }\n}"}, "Go": {"langSlug": "golang", "code": "func minDeletions(s string) int {\n    \n}"}, "Ruby": {"langSlug": "ruby", "code": "# @param {String} s\n# @return {Integer}\ndef min_deletions(s)\n    \nend"}, "Scala": {"langSlug": "scala", "code": "object Solution {\n    def minDeletions(s: String): Int = {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Rust": {"langSlug": "rust", "code": "impl Solution {\n    pub fn min_deletions(s: String) -> i32 {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Racket": {"langSlug": "racket", "code": "(define/contract (min-deletions s)\n  (-> string? exact-integer?)\n  )"}, "Erlang": {"langSlug": "erlang", "code": "-spec min_deletions(S :: unicode:unicode_binary()) -> integer().\nmin_deletions(S) ->\n  ."}, "Elixir": {"langSlug": "elixir", "code": "defmodule Solution do\n  @spec min_deletions(s :: String.t) :: integer\n  def min_deletions(s) do\n    \n  end\nend"}}}
