For example, the postfix tokens of the expression <code>4*(5-(7+2))</code> are represented in the array <code>postfix = [&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;,&quot;7&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;+&quot;,&quot;-&quot;,&quot;*&quot;]</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The class <code>Node</code> is an interface you should use to implement the binary expression tree. The returned tree will be tested using the <code>evaluate</code> function, which is supposed to evaluate the tree&#39;s value. You should not remove the <code>Node</code> class; however, you can modify it as you wish, and you can define other classes to implement it if needed.</p>\n\n<p>A <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree\" target=\"_blank\">binary expression tree</a></strong> is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators <code>&#39;+&#39;</code> (addition), <code>&#39;-&#39;</code> (subtraction), <code>&#39;*&#39;</code> (multiplication), and <code>&#39;/&#39;</code> (division).</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s guaranteed that no subtree will yield a value that exceeds <code>10<sup>9</sup></code> in absolute value, and all the operations are valid (i.e., no division by zero).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Follow up:</strong> Could you design the expression tree such that it is more modular? For example, is your design able to support additional operators without making changes to your existing <code>evaluate</code> implementation?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/untitled-diagram.png\" style=\"width: 242px; height: 241px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> s = [&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;+&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;*&quot;,&quot;7&quot;,&quot;/&quot;]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression (<code>(3+4)*2)/7) = 14/7 = 2.</code>\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/untitled-diagram2.png\" style=\"width: 222px; height: 232px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> s = [&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;7&quot;,&quot;+&quot;,&quot;-&quot;,&quot;*&quot;]\n<strong>Output:</strong> -16\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression 4*(5-<code>(2+7)) = 4*(-4) = -16.</code>\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt; 100</code></li>\n\t<li><code>s.length</code> is odd.</li>\n\t<li><code>s</code> consists of numbers and the characters <code>&#39;+&#39;</code>, <code>&#39;-&#39;</code>, <code>&#39;*&#39;</code>, and <code>&#39;/&#39;</code>.</li>\n\t<li>If <code>s[i]</code> is a number, its integer representation is no more than <code>10<sup>5</sup></code>.</li>\n\t<li>It is guaranteed that <code>s</code> is a valid expression.</li>\n\t<li>The absolute value of the result and intermediate values will not exceed <code>10<sup>9</sup></code>.</li>\n\t<li>It is guaranteed that no expression will include division by zero.</li>\n</ul>\n", "hints": ["Apply the concept of Polymorphism to get a good design", "Implement the Node class using NumericNode and OperatorNode classes.", "NumericNode only maintains the value and evaluate returns this value.", "OperatorNode Maintains the left and right nodes representing the left and right operands, and the evaluate function applies the operator to them."], "exampleTestcases": "[\"3\",\"4\",\"+\",\"2\",\"*\",\"7\",\"/\"]\n[\"4\",\"5\",\"2\",\"7\",\"+\",\"-\",\"*\"]", "codeSnippets": [{"lang": "C++", "langSlug": "cpp", "code": "/**\n * This is the interface for the expression tree Node.\n * You should not remove it, and you can define some classes to implement it.\n */\n\nclass Node {\npublic:\n    virtual ~Node () {};\n    virtual int evaluate() const = 0;\nprotected:\n    // define your fields here\n};\n\n\n/**\n * This is the TreeBuilder class.\n * You can treat it as the driver code that takes the postinfix input \n * and returns the expression tree representing it as a Node.\n */\n\nclass TreeBuilder {\npublic:\n    Node* buildTree(vector<string>& postfix) {\n        \n    }\n};\n\n\n/**\n * Your TreeBuilder object will be instantiated and called as such:\n * TreeBuilder* obj = new TreeBuilder();\n * Node* expTree = obj->buildTree(postfix);\n * int ans = expTree->evaluate();\n */"}, {"lang": "Java", "langSlug": "java", "code": "/**\n * This is the interface for the expression tree Node.\n * You should not remove it, and you can define some classes to implement it.\n */\n\nabstract class Node {\n    public abstract int evaluate();\n    // define your fields here\n};\n\n\n/**\n * This is the TreeBuilder class.\n * You can treat it as the driver code that takes the postinfix input \n * and returns the expression tree representing it as a Node.\n */\n\nclass TreeBuilder {\n    Node buildTree(String[] postfix) {\n        \n    }\n};\n\n\n/**\n * Your TreeBuilder object will be instantiated and called as such:\n * TreeBuilder obj = new TreeBuilder();\n * Node expTree = obj.buildTree(postfix);\n * int ans = expTree.evaluate();\n */"}, {"lang": "Python", "langSlug": "python", "code": "import abc \nfrom abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod \n\"\"\"\nThis is the interface for the expression tree Node.\nYou should not remove it, and you can define some classes to implement it.\n\"\"\"\n\nclass Node:\n    __metaclass__ = ABCMeta\n    #
