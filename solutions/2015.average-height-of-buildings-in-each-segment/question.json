The street has building(s) on it and is represented by a 2D integer array <code>buildings</code>, where <code>buildings[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>, height<sub>i</sub>]</code>. This means that there is a building with <code>height<sub>i</sub></code> in the <strong>half-closed segment</strong> <code>[start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You want to <strong>describe</strong> the heights of the buildings on the street with the <strong>minimum</strong> number of non-overlapping <strong>segments</strong>. The street can be represented by the 2D integer array <code>street</code> where <code>street[j] = [left<sub>j</sub>, right<sub>j</sub>, average<sub>j</sub>]</code> describes a <strong>half-closed segment</strong> <code>[left<sub>j</sub>, right<sub>j</sub>)</code> of the road where the <strong>average</strong> heights of the buildings in the<strong> segment</strong> is <code>average<sub>j</sub></code>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>For example, if <code>buildings = [[1,5,2],[3,10,4]],</code> the street could be represented by <code>street = [[1,3,2],[3,5,3],[5,10,4]]</code> because:\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>From 1 to 3, there is only the first building with an average height of <code>2 / 1 = 2</code>.</li>\n\t\t<li>From 3 to 5, both the first and the second building are there with an average height of <code>(2+4) / 2 = 3</code>.</li>\n\t\t<li>From 5 to 10, there is only the second building with an average height of <code>4 / 1 = 4</code>.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Given <code>buildings</code>, return <em>the 2D integer array </em><code>street</code><em> as described above (<strong>excluding</strong> any areas of the street where there are no buldings).
