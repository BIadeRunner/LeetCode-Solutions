The cars are numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> from left to right and each car is present at a <strong>unique</strong> point.</p>\n\n<p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> string <code>directions</code> of length <code>n</code>. <code>directions[i]</code> can be either <code>&#39;L&#39;</code>, <code>&#39;R&#39;</code>, or <code>&#39;S&#39;</code> denoting whether the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> car is moving towards the <strong>left</strong>, towards the <strong>right</strong>, or <strong>staying</strong> at its current point respectively.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, the number of collisions becomes 0 + 2 = 2.\n- Cars 2 and 3 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 2 + 1 = 3.\n- Cars 3 and 4 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 3 + 1 = 4.\n- Cars 4 and 5 will collide with each other. After car 4 collides with car 3, it will stay at the point of collision and get hit by car 5. The number of collisions becomes 4 + 1 = 5.\nThus, the total number of collisions that will happen on the road is 5. \n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> directions = &quot;LLRR&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\nNo cars will collide with each other.
