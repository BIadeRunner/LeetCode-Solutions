In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.\nThe result format is in the following example.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nActivity table:\n+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+\n| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |\n+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+\n| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |\n| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |\n| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |\n| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |\n| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |\n+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+\nOutput: \n+-----------+\n| fraction  |\n+-----------+\n| 0.33      |\n+-----------+\nExplanation: \nOnly the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33\n\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\":{\"Activity\":[\"player_id\",\"device_id\",\"event_date\",\"games_played\"]},\"rows\":{\"Activity\":[[1,2,\"2016-03-01\",5],[1,2,\"2016-03-02\",6],[2,3,\"2017-06-25\",1],[3,1,\"2016-03-02\",0],[3,4,\"2018-07-03\",5]]}}", "codeSnippets": {"MySQL": {"langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, "MS SQL Server": {"langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Oracle": {"langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Pandas": {"langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef gameplay_analysis(activity: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, "PostgreSQL": {"langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}}}
