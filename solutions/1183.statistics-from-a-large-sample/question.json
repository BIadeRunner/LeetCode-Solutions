{"question_id": "1183", "problem_slug": "statistics-from-a-large-sample", "problem_title": "Statistics from a Large Sample", "content": "You are given a large sample of integers in the range [0, 255]. Since the sample is so large, it is represented by an array count where count[k] is the number of times that k appears in the sample.\nCalculate the following statistics:\n\nminimum: The minimum element in the sample.\nmaximum: The maximum element in the sample.\nmean: The average of the sample, calculated as the total sum of all elements divided by the total number of elements.\nmedian:\n\t\nIf the sample has an odd number of elements, then the median is the middle element once the sample is sorted.\nIf the sample has an even number of elements, then the median is the average of the two middle elements once the sample is sorted.\n\n\nmode: The number that appears the most in the sample. It is guaranteed to be unique.\n\nReturn the statistics of the sample as an array of floating-point numbers [minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode]. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: count = [0,1,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput: [1.00000,3.00000,2.37500,2.50000,3.00000]\nExplanation: The sample represented by count is [1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3].\nThe minimum and maximum are 1 and 3 respectively.\nThe mean is (1+2+2+2+3+3+3+3) / 8 = 19 / 8 = 2.375.\nSince the size of the sample is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements 2 and 3, which is 2.5.\nThe mode is 3 as it appears the most in the sample.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: count = [0,4,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput: [1.00000,4.00000,2.18182,2.00000,1.00000]\nExplanation: The sample represented by count is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4].\nThe minimum and maximum are 1 and 4 respectively.\nThe mean is (1+1+1+1+2+2+2+3+3+4+4) / 11 = 24 / 11 = 2.18181818... (for display purposes, the output shows the rounded number 2.18182).\nSince the size of the sample is odd, the median is the middle element 2.\nThe mode is 1 as it appears the most in the sample.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\ncount.length == 256\n0 <= count[i] <= 109\n1 <= sum(count) <= 109\nThe mode of the sample that count represents is unique.\n\n", "hints": ["The hard part is the median.
