{"question_id": "2157", "problem_slug": "smallest-k-length-subsequence-with-occurrences-of-a-letter", "problem_title": "Smallest K-Length Subsequence With Occurrences of a Letter", "content": "You are given a string s, an integer k, a letter letter, and an integer repetition.\nReturn the lexicographically smallest subsequence of s of length k that has the letter letter appear at least repetition times. The test cases are generated so that the letter appears in s at least repetition times.\nA subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"leet\", k = 3, letter = \"e\", repetition = 1\nOutput: \"eet\"\nExplanation: There are four subsequences of length 3 that have the letter 'e' appear at least 1 time:\n- \"lee\" (from \"leet\")\n- \"let\" (from \"leet\")\n- \"let\" (from \"leet\")\n- \"eet\" (from \"leet\")\nThe lexicographically smallest subsequence among them is \"eet\".\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: s = \"leetcode\", k = 4, letter = \"e\", repetition = 2\nOutput: \"ecde\"\nExplanation: \"ecde\" is the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length 4 that has the letter \"e\" appear at least 2 times.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"bb\", k = 2, letter = \"b\", repetition = 2\nOutput: \"bb\"\nExplanation: \"bb\" is the only subsequence of length 2 that has the letter \"b\" appear at least 2 times.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= repetition <= k <= s.length <= 5 * 104\ns consists of lowercase English letters.\nletter is a lowercase English letter, and appears in s at least repetition times.\n\n", "hints": ["Use stack.
