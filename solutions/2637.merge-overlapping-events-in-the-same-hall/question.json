We merge them in one event [\"2023-01-13\", \"2023-01-17\"].\n- The event [\"2023-01-18\", \"2023-01-25\"] does not overlap with any other event, so we leave it as it is.\nHall 2:\n- The two events [\"2022-12-09\", \"2022-12-23\"] and [\"2022-12-13\", \"2022-12-17\"] overlap. We merge them in one event [\"2022-12-09\", \"2022-12-23\"].\nHall 3:\n- The hall has only one event, so we return it. Note that we only consider the events of each hall separately.\n\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\": {\"HallEvents\": [\"hall_id\", \"start_day\", \"end_day\"]}, \"rows\": {\"HallEvents\": [[1, \"2023-01-13\", \"2023-01-14\"], [1, \"2023-01-14\", \"2023-01-17\"], [1, \"2023-01-18\", \"2023-01-25\"], [2, \"2022-12-09\", \"2022-12-23\"], [2, \"2022-12-13\", \"2022-12-17\"], [3, \"2022-12-01\", \"2023-01-30\"]]}}", "codeSnippets": {"MySQL": {"langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, "MS SQL Server": {"langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Oracle": {"langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Pandas": {"langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef merge_events(hall_events: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}}}
