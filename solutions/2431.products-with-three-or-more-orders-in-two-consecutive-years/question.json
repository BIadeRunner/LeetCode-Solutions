Since it was ordered three times in two consecutive years, we include it in the answer.\nProduct 2 was ordered one time in 2022. We do not include it in the answer.\n\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\": {\"Orders\": [\"order_id\", \"product_id\", \"quantity\", \"purchase_date\"]}, \"rows\": {\"Orders\": [[1, 1, 7, \"2020-03-16\"], [2, 1, 4, \"2020-12-02\"], [3, 1, 7, \"2020-05-10\"], [4, 1, 6, \"2021-12-23\"], [5, 1, 5, \"2021-05-21\"], [6, 1, 6, \"2021-10-11\"], [7, 2, 6, \"2022-10-11\"]]}}", "codeSnippets": {"MySQL": {"langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, "MS SQL Server": {"langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Oracle": {"langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Pandas": {"langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef find_valid_products(orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, "PostgreSQL": {"langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}}}
