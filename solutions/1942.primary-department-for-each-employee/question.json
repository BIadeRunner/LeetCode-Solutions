If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.\n\n \nEmployees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is 'N'.\nWrite a solution to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.\nReturn the result table in any order.\nThe result format is in the following example.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nEmployee table:\n+-------------+---------------+--------------+\n| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |\n+-------------+---------------+--------------+\n| 1           | 1             | N            |\n| 2           | 1             | Y            |\n| 2           | 2             | N            |\n| 3           | 3             | N            |\n| 4           | 2             | N            |\n| 4           | 3             | Y            |\n| 4           | 4             | N            |\n+-------------+---------------+--------------+\nOutput: \n+-------------+---------------+\n| employee_id | department_id |\n+-------------+---------------+\n| 1           | 1             |\n| 2           | 1             |\n| 3           | 3             |\n| 4           | 3             |\n+-------------+---------------+\nExplanation: \n- The Primary department for employee 1 is 1.\n- The Primary department for employee 2 is 1.\n- The Primary department for employee 3 is 3.\n- The Primary department for employee 4 is 3.\n\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\":{\"Employee\":[\"employee_id\",\"department_id\",\"primary_flag\"]},\"rows\":{\"Employee\":[[\"1\",\"1\",\"N\"],[\"2\",\"1\",\"Y\"],[\"2\",\"2\",\"N\"],[\"3\",\"3\",\"N\"],[\"4\",\"2\",\"N\"],[\"4\",\"3\",\"Y\"],[\"4\",\"4\",\"N\"]]}}", "codeSnippets": {"MySQL": {"langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, "MS SQL Server": {"langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Oracle": {"langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Pandas": {"langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef find_primary_department(employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, "PostgreSQL": {"langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}}}
