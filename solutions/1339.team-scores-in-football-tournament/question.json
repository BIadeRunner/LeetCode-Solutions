Points are awarded as follows:\n\n\nA team receives three points if they win a match (i.e., Scored more goals than the opponent team).\nA team receives one point if they draw a match (i.e., Scored the same number of goals as the opponent team).\nA team receives no points if they lose a match (i.e., Scored fewer goals than the opponent team).\n\nWrite a solution that selects the team_id, team_name and num_points of each team in the tournament after all described matches.\nReturn the result table ordered by num_points in decreasing order. In case of a tie, order the records by team_id in increasing order.\nThe result format is in the following example.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nTeams table:\n+-----------+--------------+\n| team_id   | team_name    |\n+-----------+--------------+\n| 10        | Leetcode FC  |\n| 20        | NewYork FC   |\n| 30        | Atlanta FC   |\n| 40        | Chicago FC   |\n| 50        | Toronto FC   |\n+-----------+--------------+\nMatches table:\n+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+\n| match_id   | host_team    | guest_team    | host_goals  | guest_goals  |\n+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+\n| 1          | 10           | 20            | 3           | 0            |\n| 2          | 30           | 10            | 2           | 2            |\n| 3          | 10           | 50            | 5           | 1            |\n| 4          | 20           | 30            | 1           | 0            |\n| 5          | 50           | 30            | 1           | 0            |\n+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+\nOutput: \n+------------+--------------+---------------+\n| team_id    | team_name    | num_points    |\n+------------+--------------+---------------+\n| 10         | Leetcode FC  | 7             |\n| 20         | NewYork FC   | 3             |\n| 50         | Toronto FC   | 3             |\n| 30         | Atlanta FC   | 1             |\n| 40         | Chicago FC   | 0             |\n+------------+--------------+---------------+\n\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\": {\"Teams\": [\"team_id\", \"team_name\"], \"Matches\": [\"match_id\", \"host_team\", \"guest_team\", \"host_goals\", \"guest_goals\"]}, \"rows\": {\"Teams\": [[10, \"Leetcode FC\"], [20, \"NewYork FC\"], [30, \"Atlanta FC\"], [40, \"Chicago FC\"], [50, \"Toronto FC\"]], \"Matches\": [[1, 10, 20, 3, 0], [2, 30, 10, 2, 2], [3, 10, 50, 5, 1], [4, 20, 30, 1, 0], [5, 50, 30, 1, 0]]}}", "codeSnippets": {"MySQL": {"langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, "MS SQL Server": {"langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Oracle": {"langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Pandas": {"langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef team_scores(teams: pd.DataFrame, matches: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, "PostgreSQL": {"langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}}}
