In other words, if the maximum number of common followers between any two users is maxCommon, then you have to return all pairs of users that have maxCommon common followers.\nThe result table should contain the pairs user1_id and user2_id where user1_id < user2_id.\nReturn the result table in any order.\nThe result format is in the following example.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nRelations table:\n+---------+-------------+\n| user_id | follower_id |\n+---------+-------------+\n| 1       | 3           |\n| 2       | 3           |\n| 7       | 3           |\n| 1       | 4           |\n| 2       | 4           |\n| 7       | 4           |\n| 1       | 5           |\n| 2       | 6           |\n| 7       | 5           |\n+---------+-------------+\nOutput: \n+----------+----------+\n| user1_id | user2_id |\n+----------+----------+\n| 1        | 7        |\n+----------+----------+\nExplanation: \nUsers 1 and 2 have two common followers (3 and 4).\nUsers 1 and 7 have three common followers (3, 4, and 5).\nUsers 2 and 7 have two common followers (3 and 4).\nSince the maximum number of common followers between any two users is 3, we return all pairs of users with three common followers, which is only the pair (1, 7). We return the pair as (1, 7), not as (7, 1).\nNote that we do not have any information about the users that follow users 3, 4, and 5, so we consider them to have 0 followers.\n\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\":{\"Relations\":[\"user_id\",\"follower_id\"]},\"rows\":{\"Relations\":[[1,3],[2,3],[7,3],[1,4],[2,4],[7,4],[1,5],[2,6],[7,5]]}}", "codeSnippets": {"MySQL": {"langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, "MS SQL Server": {"langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Oracle": {"langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Pandas": {"langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef find_pairs(relations: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, "PostgreSQL": {"langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}}}
